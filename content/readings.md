# Reading List

Here are some books I am currently reading:

1. *Principles of Mathematical Analysis (Third Edition)* by Walter Rudin
   * Refresh my memory of mathematical analysis.
2. *Introduction to Linear Optimization* by Dimitris Bertsimas and John Tsitsiklis
   * My emphasis is on section 4 (Duality theory).
3. *A Modern Introduction to Online Learning* by Francesco Orabona

Hopefully I can finish them by March 2025  ;)
