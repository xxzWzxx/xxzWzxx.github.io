        I want to apply machine learning methods to traditional operations management problems to help people make good decisions efficiently and transparently. Currently, I decompose this goal into two parts: 

        (i) identifying and utilizing key problem structures that lead to efficiency and explainability in algorithms, 

        (ii) developing algorithms that systematically translate advances in machine learning into data-driven decision-making methods.
  
        I am currently focusing on business operation. I am willing to explore healthcare operation and other topics in the future!

        My dream is to make the world a better place through my research. üåè
